<p>
We decided after some time of mourning the loss of our first cat, that home wasnt the same without a little furry friend to 
greet us everyday when we came home. So we drove up to the Humane Society to find us a baby kitten. We had two in mind, however when we got there, only one of them was
still there. We were a little bummed as we wanted to make the perfect decision and one that bonded with us almost instantly and 
captured our hearts. Though we decided to at least wait for the one kitten, we figured never know, maybe this happened for a reason.
We were waiting in the waiting area across the viewing rooms where you could view kittens and while waiting we noticed this older cat
staring at us lovingly. We visited her momentarily and she was very loving from the start. She was 2 1/2 years old and was given up at 10 months by her first family and spent 
most of her life there, we knew we had to save her like she knew she had to save us as well, so we adopted our new furry child!

<p>
When we first brought her home she was so curious about her surroundings. This was a whole new world for her and one she was no longer
trapped in, she could finally explore! She is very smart, always coming when called and so adorable. She is very active in her exploring and wanting to get into everything and anything and She
won our hearts instantly. At first we admit, it was still hard, we were very close to our other cat that we were not ready to let go 
of at her young age of five years old but she quickly helped us heal. We helped her heal as well as we realized also when we brought
her home that she was so scared of any sudden movement or if she thought we would be mad about something. Though as time has gone on
she too has been healing from that as well with us.

She has many odd traits for example we swear she thinks she is a monkey, a mouse and a meerkat all in one! Her tail is so cute because it curled like a monkey's tail and would
hook onto things as well or wrap around your wrist. Whenever she meowed it isn't a cat's meow, it sounds more like a squeaking mouse! 
it is so adorable and makes her so unique! Whenever she hears noises she stands up on her two back legs like a meerkat does 
and she loves watching tv with us as well. She now knows she has a loving forever home and loving parents who will spoil her
the rest of her life.
